# palletDashboard
Dashboard that I created using RShiny to look at how specific products are moving across North America.

To use:
1) download the 2 files (.R and .js) and the amocTelemReport folder of csv files.
2) edit the dashboard.R filePath variable in line 11 to reflect the file path that the csv files are in.
3) run dashboard.R


The JavaScript plug-in is NOT mine. I found it from another Github account at https://github.com/bbecquet/Leaflet.PolylineDecorator
